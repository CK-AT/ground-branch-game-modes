HostageRescue,Hostage Rescue,
HostageRescueRulesOfEngagement1,"One member of the attacking team has been taken hostage in one of the buildings, selected at random by the game mode. The defenders' movements are restricted to within that building, unless and until the hostage escapes the building. Defenders can lead the hostage around the building or simply hold them in place, and they can intimidate the hostage into silence by pointing a gun at the hostage, but you will need two defenders to do both at the same time.\r\nAttackers will have to find the building where the hostage is being held, possibly with the assistance of the hostage making some noise. Attackers must then breach the building and rescue the hostage. If the hostage has their cuffs released by the attackers, they will regain a full range of movement and team comms. To win the round, the attacking team must escort the hostage to an extraction point with at least one other attacker, or alternatively they can eliminate the defending team.\r\nTo win the round, the defending team must eliminate all attackers, or survive the onslaught until the time runs out. Any team that kills the hostage will instantly lose the match. Careful with those frags, people.",
HostageRescueRulesOfEngagement2,"If there are not enough players to start a Hostage Rescue round, then the stripped down Building Assault mode will start, in which the defenders are still restricted to a building, but there is no hostage and the teams must simply eliminate each other. The gloves are off in this mode!\r\nThe game mode uses quite aggressive autobalancing to maintain fair teams, so make sure both your red team and blue team kits are up to date.",
